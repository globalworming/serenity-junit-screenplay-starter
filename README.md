# Serenity JUnit Screenplay Starter project
*no cucumbers where harmed during development*
  
This is a minimalistic example using Serenity BDD with the screenplay patter but without Cucumber. It shows how actors with different abilities can work on different interfaces in isolation or in collaboration. 

## Get the code

Git:

    git git@github.com:globalworming/serenity-junit-screenplay-starter.git
    cd serenity-junit-screenplay-starter

## Use Maven

Open a command window and run:

    mvn verify

## Use Gradle

Open a command window and run:

    gradlew test 


## Viewing the reports

Both of the commands provided above will produce a Serenity test report in the `target/site/serenity` directory. Go take a look!
